# Testing GraphQL with Rails 5.2.2 and ReactJS / Webpacker

> Inspired in [RailsConf 2018: Build A Blog in 15 (more like 30) Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-qY37JIdg0)

## My notes of commands
1. create GQ model `rails g graphql:object Post title:String content:String id:ID`
2. create GQ mutation `rails g graphql:mutation delete_comment`
3. create GQ mutation for create post `rails g graphql:mutation create_post`
